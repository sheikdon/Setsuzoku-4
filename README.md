# project_1
for my game i will be doing an among us style game but turn it into a hard game style. the objective is as the last remaining crewmate is to move throw space away from the dead crewmates and trash and reach the the end and hit the emergency button. the objects will come flying horizontally so you have to move pass them or you die. there will be levels included in the game.


or

for the other game i will be doing a connect 4 style game . you will have to play against another person which means its a 2 player game. you will have to connect 4 to win the game before the other opponnet.


I plan on using my week on certain parts of the code. I know that i will spend most of my time with html and javascript so i will dedicate most of the week on them.
